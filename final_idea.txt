Project Topic:

Development of a mathematical toolbox and associated scripting language in haskell (similar to Octave, but will try to use functional programming concepts for efficient implementation).
Functionalities:

    Plotting functions (line graphs, surface and contour diagrams)
    Root finding (for polynomials and general functions by NR, bisection and other algorithms)
    Solving a system of multivariable equations, eigen value problems, determinants, Gauss elimination, LU decomposition etc
    Symbolic differentiation of functions, symbolic integration
    Logical deductions and stat solver
    Numerical solutions to derivatives, intergrals and ODEs

Further, time permitting:

    Optimization problems (LP and NLP)
    Fourier Transforms
    Numerical solution to PDEs
